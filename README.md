# Daily Developer Dashboard Branding

The Daily Developer Dashboard (3D) is a tool developed by Team Snowplough in order to make their fellow developers lives easier. This repo is just to allow them to explore their branding in a developer-centric environment with changes made easily and instantly in a language that is easy to understand.

### Installation

Install the npm dependencies

```sh
$ npm i
```

Start the TypeScript transpiler/watcher. This will transpile the TypeScript into JavaScript files, watch for changes and re-transpile any differences.
```sh
$ npm run watch:typescript
```

In a new terminal window start the server
```sh
$ npm start
```

**Hail to the king baby!**
